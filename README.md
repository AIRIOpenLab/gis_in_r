Open-Sourced Tutorials for working with GIS data in R currently hosted at www.nickeubank.com/gis-in-r

To-Do
=================
* **Migrate to a stand-alone domain**: given contributions of others, it no longer feels appropriate to host on my own site (www.nickeubank.com/gis-in-r). I've registered www.gis-in-r.org, just need to build index page. 
* **Add Makefiles**: The current setup makes it hard to easily update and re-make all the markdown documents, so next step is adding a makefile to automate the process. 
* **Remove any reference to @data?** Since updating how attribute merges are done, it's not clear users need to be exposed to the `@data` operation. Worth removing? Suggested by @edzer.
