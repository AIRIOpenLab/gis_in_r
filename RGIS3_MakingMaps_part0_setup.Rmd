```{r knitr_init, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(rmdformats)

## Global options
options(max.print="75")
opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE,
	             cache=TRUE,
               prompt=FALSE,
               tidy=TRUE,
               comment=NA,
               message=FALSE,
               warning=FALSE)
opts_knit$set(width=75)

```



Try:

```{r}
install.packages(c("ggplot2","hexbin","ggmap","RColorBrewer", "XML", "dplyr"))
```

Plus, as before, `sp` and `rgdal`. 

R comes wiht a basic `plot` command, which can also be used for simple map viewing. In this workshop we will will look into two different options to map spatial data in R. `sp` comes with a more refined plot command `spplot`, which takes `Spatial*~` objects. Secondly, there is `ggplot`, a more general purpose plotting library, but very powerful and one can make great maps. An additional package `ggmap` builds on `ggplot` and allows to draw in tiled basemaps from different services.
