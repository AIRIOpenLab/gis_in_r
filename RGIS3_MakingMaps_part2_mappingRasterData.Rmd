# 1. Plotting Rasters
Rasters are generally plotted using the `plot` command from the `raster` library. Like many functions in the `raster` library, the syntax is relatively straightfoward. For example, consider the following plot of a US population count raster:

```{r}
library(raster)
us.pop <- raster("RGIS3_Data/us_population_raster.asc")
plot(us.pop)
```

## 1.1 Managing Breaks

As you can see, however, the raster seems kind of washed out due to the color scaling -- most places have no-one, so the default color ramp results in most places being empty. The easiest fix is to just take logs as follows:

```{r}
us.pop.logged <- us.pop
values(us.pop.logged)<- log(values(us.pop.logged))
plot(us.pop.logged)
```

But the more sophisticated solution is to use the `classInt` library just as we did with vector data:

```{r}
library(classInt)

# First, we need to drop the 0 values in population. There are SO MANY that it confuses classInterval
value.vector <- values(us.pop)
value.vector <- value.vector[value.vector != 0]

breaks.qt <- classIntervals(value.vector, n = 15, style = "quantile", intervalClosure="right")

plot(us.pop, breaks = breaks.qt$brks)

```

## 1.2 Managing Colors

We can also use custom colors as with `spplot`, though not you don't have to pass the number of cuts to `plot` as you did with `spplot`:
```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
my.palette <- brewer.pal(n = 20, name = "OrRd")
plot(us.pop.logged, col=my.palette)
```

## 1.3 Managing Extent

Controlling zoom is similar, thought slightly different from with `spplot`. The raster `plot` command takes an `extent` argument rather than `xlim` and `ylim` arguments, though the idea is that same. So to trim this picture to the Western US, you could type:

```{r}
# Make an extent object, that was a vector with four values: xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax
new.extent<- extent(c(-125, -100, 20, 50))

plot(us.pop.logged, ext=new.extent)
```
