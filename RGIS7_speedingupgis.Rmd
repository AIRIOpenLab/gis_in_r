First, my apologies -- this is just a skeleton of a tutorial for now, but seems worth putting up even in this form!

# Nearest Neighbor

The naive way to find nearest neighbors is to use the `gDistance` function in the `rgeos` library to find the distance from each point in one dataset to each point in another. In small datasets, this works find, but it doesn't scale -- the number of calculations you need to do quickly explodes. 

A better way is to use what's called a "Spatial Index" -- a very fancy algorithmic shortcut for limiting the number of calculations a computer needs to make. 

R has a great library for this called `SearchTrees`, and you can easily use it to find a nearest neighbor (or in this case, the two nearest neighbors) as follows (with all credit to Josh O'Brien for this code snippet):

```{r}

library(sp)
library(SearchTrees)

## Example data
set.seed(1)
A <- SpatialPoints(cbind(x=rnorm(100), y=rnorm(100)))
B <- SpatialPoints(cbind(x=c(-1, 0, 1), y=c(1, 0, -1)))

## Find indices of the two nearest points in A to each of the points in B.
  # If you just want the one nearest neighbor, set `k=1`. 
tree <- createTree(coordinates(A))
inds <- knnLookup(tree, newdat=coordinates(B), k=2)
```

Wanna make sure it worked? Check it out!
```{r}
## Show that it worked
plot(A, pch=1, cex=1.2)
points(B, col=c("blue", "red", "green"), pch=17, cex=1.5)
## Plot two nearest neigbors
points(A[inds[1,],], pch=16, col=adjustcolor("blue", alpha=0.7))
points(A[inds[2,],], pch=16, col=adjustcolor("red", alpha=0.7))
points(A[inds[3,],], pch=16, col=adjustcolor("green", alpha=0.7))

```
